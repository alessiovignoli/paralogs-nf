    "This jupyter notebook analyzes the trees obtained from mislabelled (aka swapped) sequences. The sequences are from the simulated dataset. Mislabaling a paralog is equivalent to getting two paralogs and swap them while keeping their label (aka gene/paralog-ID) untouched. This will generate as a consequence erroneus orthologs assignments. Since it is the simulated dataset ortholog assignment are known a priori and are ground trouth, to simulate a real world scenario wHere there is more confusion and mistakes about orthologs assignments, we decided to swap some sequences to create wrong ortholog sets. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "The swapping happens in two steps for each family in the simulated dataset (500): first select the species to do the swapping in, then among the paralogs in that species actually swap the desired number of sequences around. Both species selection and sequence selection is random. So the swapping combination (10, 9) refers to selcting 10 species in which 9 sequences will be swapped. The 9 sequences are swapped among themselves.\n",
